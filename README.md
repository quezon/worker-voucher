Alternative Economy using Hour Vouchers and Hour Participation Tokens aka Worker Voucher Ecosystem

# Open Source
- Licensed as Open Source
- Need volunteer coders
- Decentralized, Immutable, Distributed Ledger 
- Proof not based on Proof of Work

# Goals/Vision of this Project
- To distinguish it from Capitalistic coins like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoins, Dogecoin etc
- To provide alternatives to people to lift up their living conditions
- To equitably distribute wealth without coercion through market forces
- To discourage people from speculation and instead work to gain hour vouchers through the use of this cryptovoucher ecosystem 

# Hour Vouchers
- Given to workers who work for the enterprise
- Used to buy goods and services from other participating enterprises
- Gets consummed/deleted from circulation once spent. It is not circulated.
- Nonconvertible to other currencies. Can only be used to buy goods/services from willing merchants
- Can be divisible to lower units 1 hr = 60 minutes = 3600 seconds =  3.6e+12 nanoseconds
- The smallest unit is nanoseconds in terms of hours

# Hour Bonds/ Participation Token
- Computed by No. of Years the person has lived * No. of Hours in a Year
Ex: 20 y/o * 365 days * 24 hrs = 175,200 hour bonds/ token ownership
- Can be loaned only to Participating Worker Owned Enterprises without interest
- Person can be penalized or sanctioned for faking DOB
- Participants need to reach a consensus to Person’s DOB
- Expires when a person dies
- Non transferable among Individuals or Enterprises
- Person can withdraw bonds any time from enterprises.
- Nonconvertible to other forms of ownership
- Represents as participation/voting rights to the enterprise
- Ideally must be shown real-time in public like the stock exchange.

# Formula
- Total Enterprise Hour Bonds = Hour Vouchers Issued – Hour Vouchers Received + Issuable Hour Vouchers
- Total Voting Stake = Hour Vouchers Issued (Workers) + Hour Bonds Invested (Owner Participants) + Hour Vouchers Received (Customers)

# Market Forces
- Higher Labor Hour Prices discourage purchase of items.
- Higher Labor Hour Pay/Issuances encourage employees to work for the enterprise.
- Market Equilibrium eventually balances the two forces.

# Inter Enterprise Forces
- Non Profit Seeking Investors (Bond Hour Holders) are limited to withdraw their holdings by the number of hour vouchers issued minus the hour vouchers received from consumers.
- Workers are limited to receive hour vouchers by the number of hour bonds borrowed minus the hour vouchers received from consumers 

# Problems that need to be Addressed
- Double Spending
- Duplicate Wallets per Person
- False/Fraudulent Age or DOB
- Verification of DOB
- Prevent circulation of Hour Vouchers
- Limited vendors accepting Labor Vouchers
- Bad Actors that Outinvest other Participants for personal gain
- Hour Voucher can only operate with Hour Bonds

# Motivations to Production
- Profit Motive will be significantly reduced and will focus more on the overall well-being or improvement of society
- Reduction of Prices and Improvement of Living Conditions
